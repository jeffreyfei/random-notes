# Simple Storage Service \(S3\)

* Storage over the internet
* Store and retrieve and amount of data at anytime

* Every object in S3 is stored in a _bucket_

### Permissions

* Similar to normal file system permissions \(read/write, access to the ACL\)
* Can be set individually on the object level
* Can be set on the bucket level as bucket policies
  * Use the policy generator to generate the policy json

### Versioning

* Multiple variants of the same object can be kept in the same bucket
* Use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and store every version of every object
* Different versions of the object can be found beside the object's name when viewing the object's information
* Past versions have a different permission right as the latest version, needs to be set explicitly in bucket policies to open up access permission to past versions
